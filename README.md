# SimpleCalculator
Introducing my first HTML project - a custom calculator built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This calculator was designed with user experience in mind, featuring a clean and intuitive interface. 
Instead of relying on the traditional eval() method, I implemented a custom Shunting Yard Algorithm to handle the arithmetic operations, 
ensuring maximum reliability and security. 
Whether you need to perform basic calculations or complex equations, this calculator has got you covered. 

Give it a try and let me know your thoughts!
